|August 2022 - August 2023|Post-disaster rescue and reconstruction data analysis equipment based on cushioning device (person in charge)|The project combines intelligent and accurate analysis with efficient rescue and post-disaster reconstruction technology. The core concept is to minimize losses and optimize results with the help of artificial intelligence technology. The project integrates a number of advanced technologies such as mechanical cushioning devices, face recognition, gas detection, temperature detection, terrain exploration and detection. Among them, the cushioning device is powered by the track, which effectively weakens the oscillation of the device during operation and enhances stability and accuracy. The functions of face recognition and gas and temperature detection are realized through Python function libraries and specific sensors, and SLAM is constructed by using lidar and binocular vision. The whole project was developed on the ROS system and Linux operating system, using many advanced development tools and technologies, demonstrating the technical depth and breadth of the project.|**1**.Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program for College Students.<br>**2**."CCB Cup" The 9th China International "Internet+" College Student Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition-Provincial Bronze Award.<br>**3**.Published one paper in English.|
